A sample dynamic webpage created using Bootstrap 5.0 and Three.js r135 for use as an example final project for the January 2022 session of the MIT-MEET (Middle East Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow) program.  The page is a simple flaschard maker that allows users to add flashcards using text inputs, practice and navigate through their set of cards using the gui, and save and upload cards made during another session.
